* regfmt
/regfmt/ is a command line utility to generate SVG diagrams for control register-style data formats. It is inspired by the /dformat/ command from the /troff/ family of tools, however it is re-imagined using contemporary file formats.

** Features
- Modern configuration input file format (YAML)
- SVG output
- CSS styling support



* Examples

#+begin_src shell
  $ regfmt -o register.svg register.yaml
#+end_src


Given a file ~register.yaml~ with the following contents.
